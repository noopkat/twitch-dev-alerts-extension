# Developer Alerts Twitch Extension
a Twitch extension to show Github related alerts for the repositories you're livecoding on

 This extension is a front-end only application that receives broadcasts from GitHub Actions running on the repositories you'd like notifications for. Currently, the events this extension shows are issues, pull requests, and check suites.

The [source for the GitHub Action Docker container is also on GitHub](https://github.com/noopkat/twitch-dev-alerts-action).
